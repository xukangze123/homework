# 1 computer
A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically via computer programming. Modern computers have the ability to follow generalized sets of operations, called programs. These programs enable computers to perform an extremely wide range of tasks.
# 2 计算机
电子计算机，亦称电脑，计算机是一种利用数字电子技术，根据一系列指令指示其自动执行任意算术或逻辑操作串行的设备。通用计算机因有能遵循被称为“程序”的一般操作集的能力而使得它们能够执行极其广泛的任务。
# 3 computer science
Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information. An alternative, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.[1] See glossary of computer science.
# 4 计算机科学
计算机科学（英语：computer science，有时缩写为CS）是系统性研究信息与计算的理论基础以及它们在计算机系统中如何实现与应用的实用技术的学科。[1] [2]它通常被形容为对那些创造、描述以及转换信息的算法处理的系统研究。计算机科学包含很多分支领域；有些强调特定结果的计算，比如计算机图形学；而有些是探讨计算问题的性质，比如计算复杂性理论；还有一些领域专注于怎样实现计算，比如编程语言理论是研究描述计算的方法，而程序设计是应用特定的编程语言解决特定的计算问题，人机交互则是专注于怎样使计算机和计算变得有用、好用，以及随时随地为人所用。
# 5 software
Computer software, or simply software, is a generic term that refers to a collection of data or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built, that actually performs the work. In computer science and software engineering, computer software is all information processed by computer systems, programs and data. Computer software includes computer programs, libraries and related non-executable data, such as online documentation or digital media. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.
# 6 软件
软件（英语：software）是一系列按照特定顺序组织的计算机数据和指示，是计算机中的非有形部分。计算机中的有形部分称为硬件，由计算机的外壳及各零件及电路所组成。计算机软件需有硬件才能运作，反之亦然，软件和硬件都无法在不互相配合的情形下进行实际的运作。
# 7 Software engineering 
Notable definitions of software engineering include:

"the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software"—The Bureau of Labor Statistics—IEEE Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary[4]
"The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software"—IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology[5]
"an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production"—Ian Sommerville[6]
"the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines"—Fritz Bauer[7]
# 8 软件工程
1968年秋季，NATO（北约）的科技委员会召集了近50名一流的编程人员、计算器科学家和工业界巨头，讨论和制定摆脱“软件危机”的对策。在那次会议上第一次提出了软件工程（software engineering）这个概念，研究和应用如何以系统性的、规范化的、可定量的过程化方法去开发和维护软件，以及如何把经过时间考验而证明正确的管理技术和当前能够得到的最好的技术方法结合起来的学科。它涉及到程序设计语言、数据库、软件开发工具、系统平台、标准、设计模式等方面。其后的几十年里，各种有关软件工程的技术、思想、方法和概念不断被提出，软件工程逐步发展为一门独立的科学。
# 9 Alan Turing
Alan Mathison Turing OBE FRS (/ˈtjʊərɪŋ/; 23 June 1912 – 7 June 1954) was an English computer scientist, mathematician, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist.[2] Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general purpose computer.[7][8][9] Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence.[10] However, he was also a tragic figure: a hero who was never fully recognized in his home country during his lifetime due to his homosexuality, which was then a crime in the UK.
# 10 图灵
艾伦·麦席森·图灵
艾伦·麦席森·图灵，OBE，FRS（英语：Alan Mathison Turing，又译阿兰·图灵，Turing也常翻译成涂林或者杜林，1912年6月23日－1954年6月7日）是英国计算机科学家、数学家、逻辑学家、密码分析学家和理论生物学家，他被视为计算机科学与人工智能之父。
# 11 Moore's law
Moore's law is the observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles about every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit,[2] and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade.[3] In 1975,[4] looking forward to the next decade,[5] he revised the forecast to doubling every two years.[6][7][8] The period is often quoted as 18 months because of a prediction by Intel executive David House (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).[9]
# 12 摩尔定律
摩尔定律（英语：Moore's law）是由英特尔（Intel）创始人之一戈登·摩尔提出来的。其内容为：积体电路上可容纳的电晶体（晶体管）数目，约每隔两年便会增加一倍；经常被引用的“18个月”，是由英特尔首席执行官大卫·豪斯（David House）所说：预计18个月会将芯片的性能提高一倍（即更多的晶体管使其更快）。[1]
