# 软件工程定义
# 1 Software engineering
Notable definitions of software engineering include:

"the systematic application of scientific and technological knowledge, methods, and experience to the design, implementation, testing, and documentation of software"—The Bureau of Labor Statistics—IEEE Systems and software engineering - Vocabulary[4]
"The application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software"—IEEE Standard Glossary of Software Engineering Terminology[5]
"an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production"—Ian Sommerville[6]
"the establishment and use of sound engineering principles in order to economically obtain software that is reliable and works efficiently on real machines"—Fritz Bauer[7]
The term has also been used less formally:

as the informal contemporary term for the broad range of activities that were formerly called computer programming and systems analysis;[8]
as the broad term for all aspects of the practice of computer programming, as opposed to the theory of computer programming, which is called computer science;[9]
as the term embodying the advocacy of a specific approach to computer programming, one that urges that it be treated as an engineering discipline rather than an art or a craft, and advocates the codification of recommended practices.[10

软件工程的显着定义包括：

“系统地将科学技术知识，方法和经验应用于软件的设计，实施，测试和记录” - 劳工统计局 - IEEE 系统和软件工程 - 词汇[4]
“一个系统的，规范的，可量化的方法来开发，运行的应用程序，以及维护的软件 ” - IEEE 软件工程术语的标准词汇表[5]
“一个关注软件生产各个方面的工程学科” - Ian Sommerville [6]
“建立和使用合理的工程原理，以便经济地获得可靠且在真机上高效工作的软件” - Fritz Bauer [7]
该术语的使用也不那么正式：

作为以前称为计算机编程和系统分析的广泛活动的非正式当代术语; [8]
作为计算机编程实践各个方面的广义术语，与计算机编程理论相反，后者称为计算机科学 ; [9]
作为体现倡导计算机程序设计的具体方法的术语，促使它被视为工程学科而不是艺术或工艺，并提倡编纂推荐的实践。
