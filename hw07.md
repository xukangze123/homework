IR：指令寄存器，用来保存当前正在执行的一条指令 
PC：程序计数器，存放下一条指令在内存中的地址 
ACC：累加寄存器，功能是当运算器的算术逻辑单元(ALU)执行全部算术和逻辑运算时，为ALU提供一个工作区，暂时存放ALU运算结果

汇编语言：An assembly (or assembler) language,[1] often abbreviated asm, is any low-level programming language in which there is a very strong correspondence between the program's statements and the architecture's machine code instructions.[2]
## 2
编译：A compiler is computer software that primarily translates computer code from a high-level programming language to machine code to create an executable program.[1] A compiler can also be used to convert computer code written in one programming language into another programming language. Technically compilers are a type of translator that support digital devices, primarily computers.

命令式语言：In computer science, imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing how a program operates.

函数编程语言：In computer science, functional programming is a programming paradigm
## 5
过程式编程：Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call.
